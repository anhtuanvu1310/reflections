How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
    Window: FC [path_file1] [path_file2]
    MacOS, Linux: diff [path_file1] [path_file2]

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Like DropBox or GoogleDoc. History architecture: List of changed, all version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    Manually is better and make sense for check points, but automatically help save the file
when you don't remember or somethings happens(like suddenly shutdown).It help you don't loss your file
    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Great! Now it easy to track relational files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat
    git diff [ID1] [ID2]
    use q to quit view
    press "enter" or "Key_Down" to continue read
 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can fix the bug, you can reverse the older version if the new one is not better. (It likes save game)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version control
